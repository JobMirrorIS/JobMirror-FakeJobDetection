JobMirror-FakeJobDetection

PROJECT DELIVERABLE

Develop a machine learning system that classifies job postings as real or fraudulent using NLP
on job descriptions, benefits, and requirements. The system will output predictions and
visualize fraud risk through a Power BI or Tableau dashboard.

BUSINESS CASE

Online job fraud is increasing, compromising user safety and platform trust. This project
proposes an AI-driven solution to detect and classify fake job listings. By identifying scam
patterns, it enables platforms to moderate content and protects job seekers from fraud,
while offering insights into risk factors through a visual dashboard.

OBJECTIVE

To build an end-to-end fake job detection system using machine learning and NLP, and
present the outcomes in a clear, decision-supporting dashboard.
